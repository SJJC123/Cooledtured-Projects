# Cooledtured-Projects

In this repository are the three projects I have worked on while working as a Data Research Analyst Intern at Cooledtured Collections LLC. They are as follows:
1. Top ten anime list generator for the purposes of content creation on various social media platforms
2. Top ten video game rating system generator for the purposes of content creation on various social media platforms
3. Trading card game analysis for the purposes of determining which card games are popular at the moment and how they can help the company with sales and with content creation to drive viewer engagement
